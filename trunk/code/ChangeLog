------------------- CASITA 1.6 ---------------------------
MPI
- added late sender/receiver rules for MPI_Wait and 
  MPI_Waitall (generate graph nodes for enter events of 
  non-blocking MPI routines again)
- handle MPI_Test and MPI_Testall to close MPI requests
  and remove respective internal data
- simplified critical path detection for MPI 
  (reduced memory and communication overhead)
- fixed detection of the last MPI node in an interval
- use collective rule for all collectives 
  (one-to-all, all-to-one, barrier, etc.)


------------------- CASITA 1.5 ---------------------------

MPI
- handle enter events of non-blocking MPI routines as CPU
  events to reduce memory overhead
- fixed the detection of the MPI root process for 
  one-to-all communication
- handle MPI all-to-one communication with MPI collective
   rule instead of the broken one-to-all rule

OpenMP
- fixed critical path detection for OpenMP programs
- reduce CASITA memory footprint by handling OpenMP events
  other than parallel and fork/join as CPU events
- prepared OpenMP support for nested OpenMP parallel 
  regions

CUDA
- avoid deletion of CUDA nodes at the end of analysis
  intervals, if nodes are potentially used afterwards

OpenCL
- added support for OpenCL synchronization routines

Misc
- fixed blame distribution for all supported paradigms
- dramatically reduced runtime of local critical path
  detection
- added command line option to replace CASITA output files
- improved debugging output and documentation
- removed revision number in CASITA versioning


------------------- CASITA 1.4.1 -------------------------

- corrected computation and visualization of the begin and
  end of the critical path
- added flag to specify the number of top rated functions
- fixed several bugs in the MPI critical path analysis
  output
- boost is not required any more
- added csv output for optimization rating
