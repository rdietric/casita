Infos for testing
=================

 - always run the complete test suite before committing changes !

 - execute ./run_all.sh to start testing
 - traces used for testing are in traces/ directory
 - each trace must be in its own subdirectory named {nprocs}_{name}
 - the test run will report the number of successful and total tests
   and exits with SUCCESS or FAILED

 - generators/ directory contains small programs useful for creating
   new test traces
